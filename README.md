# faux_spotify_radio
Mimicking the radio function on  Spotify using PCA and shortest distance. Using the features Spotifies offer through their API, I run a PCA onto most of the numeric variables, and then simply picking the closest n points to a given song. Not the most complex method of getting similar songs, but I was something to upload to GitHub.
